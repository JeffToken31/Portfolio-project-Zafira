### üìù User Stories Table

The following table provides a detailed overview of the main functionalities of our platform, organized by user type.
It maps each feature to the corresponding user, describing the action they want to perform and the goal they aim to achieve.
This structured approach ensures clarity on priorities, responsibilities, and expected outcomes for the MVP.

### üñºÔ∏è Mockups

![Project Mockups](https://github.com/JeffToken31/Portfolio-project-Zafira/blob/main/stage3/annexes/Zafira-mockup.gif)

Our mockups were designed to give a **visual identity** to the project and to make the user stories more tangible.  
They serve as a bridge between the functional vision and the actual interface, helping both the development team and stakeholders to project themselves into the future platform.  

The design was conceived following a **Mobile First approach**, as nowadays most users access content primarily through their smartphones, while desktop usage is becoming secondary.  
This ensures that the mobile experience is fluid, accessible, and intuitive, while still providing a web version for desktop users when needed.  

To ensure accessibility, the mockups are available in multiple formats:  

- A **GIF** to quickly preview the main flows,  
- **Figma** for full exploration,  
- And **PDF exports** to preserve a static, sharable version.  

A special effort was made on the **visual identity**. The chosen color palette combines **vivid tones** with **sobriety and elegance**, in order to remain both professional and engaging.  
This balance not only enhances readability but also ensures coherence with the values of the association. Even in the absence of direct feedback, the design has been shaped to reflect the expectations expressed by its president and to stay faithful to the organization‚Äôs image.  

In short, these mockups are more than just visuals: they are a **design foundation** aligned with user needs, technical feasibility, and the association‚Äôs identity.

## üèóÔ∏èSystem Architecture

The architecture of our MVP has been designed with **modularity** and **scalability** in mind.  
It separates the responsibilities into clear layers, making the system easier to maintain, extend, and secure.

### üîπ High-Level Architecture

```

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (Next.js)

- Provides all the public pages (*mission, blog, workshops, events*).
- Two dashboards:
  - **Beneficiary Dashboard**: personalized features (calendar, testimonials).
  - **Administrator Dashboard**: content and user management.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend (NestJS)

- Organized into independent modules:
  - User, Blog, Action, Testimonial, Partner, Statistic.
- Includes transversal services:
  - Authentication
  - Notifications
  - Scheduling tasks

### üóÑÔ∏è Database (PostgreSQL)

- Central storage for all persistent entities:
  - Users, blog articles, workshops, statistics, testimonials, partners.
- Relational structure ensures **data integrity** and facilitates **reporting**.

### üåç External Services

- **Weezevent**: event registration and ticketing.
- **HelloAsso**: secure donations and sponsorships.
- **Google Auth**: authentication via Google accounts.
- **Sendgrid**: transactional emails (notifications, confirmations).

---

### üîπ Data Flow

- Users (web or mobile) interact with the **frontend**.
- For **public content** (mission, blog, events), the frontend may:
  - Call the backend, or
  - Directly embed external services (e.g., Weezevent iframe).
- **Authenticated users** (beneficiaries, admins) access dashboards, which call the **backend API**.
- The backend:
  - Communicates with the **database** for CRUD operations.
  - Synchronizes with **external services** when required (HelloAsso, Sendgrid, etc.).
- Notification services ensure **real-time** or **scheduled updates**  
  (e.g., when a testimonial is submitted or a new action is created).

### üìö System Layer Overview

The following diagram illustrates the different layers of the system (presentation, business logic, persistence, and external services), showing how responsibilities are separated to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## üß©Components, Classes & Database Design

This section details the internal structure of the MVP. It covers three main aspects:  

1. **Backend domain classes** (entities, relationships, and methods).  
2. **Database schema** (tables, attributes, and relations).  
3. **Frontend components** (UI structure and sections).  

The goal is to show how the system is organized at different levels, ensuring consistency between code, storage, and user interface.

---

### üîπ Domain Classes (Backend)

The following diagram describes the core classes of the backend domain model.  
It includes users, credentials, content modules (blogs, actions, testimonials), partners, and statistics.  
We also added enumerations such as roles, media types, and testimonial status to make entities more robust.

### üîπ Database Schema

To persist these entities, we designed a relational schema in PostgreSQL.
The diagram below shows the tables, their attributes, and how they connect.
It ensures data integrity (via foreign keys) and supports reporting features (statistics, manual entries, daily snapshots).

## üîÑSequence Diagrams

To illustrate the main runtime flows of the application, three sequence diagrams have been prepared.  
They show the interactions between frontend, backend, database and external services for critical use cases: authentication, signup, and statistics generation.

### üîê Google OAuth Authentication Flow

This diagram explains the full Google OAuth sign-in flow:

- backend provides the Google auth URL (with a CSRF state),
- user is redirected to Google and consents,
- frontend sends the returned code to the backend,
- backend exchanges the code for tokens, verifies the ID token, and creates or retrieves the user in the database,
- backend issues the application JWT and refresh token.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as User (browser)
  participant Front as Frontend (Next.js)
  participant Back as Backend (AuthService)
  participant Google as Google OAuth
  participant DB as Database

  Note over Front,Back: 1) Front asks backend for Google auth URL (state generated)
  Front->>Back: GET /api/auth/google/url
  Back-->>Front: 200 { "url": "https://accounts.google.com/...?state=STATE" }

  Note over Front,Google: 2) Browser redirected to Google auth page
  Front->>Google: GET /oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=...&state=STATE&scope=openid%20email%20profile&response_type=code
  Note over Google,User: User logs in and consents (or cancels)

  alt User cancels
    Google-->>Front: Redirect /auth/callback?error=access_denied&state=STATE
    Front->>User: Show error message
  else User consents
    Google-->>Front: Redirect /auth/callback?code=AUTH_CODE&state=STATE
    Note over Front,Back: 3) Front sends code to backend
    Front->>Back: POST /api/auth/google { "code": "AUTH_CODE", "state": "STATE" }
    Back->>Back: Validate state (CSRF check)

    alt State invalid
      Back-->>Front: 401 { "error": "invalid_state" }
    else State valid
      Note over Back,Google: 4) Backend exchanges code for tokens
      Back->>Google: POST /token (code, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
      alt Token exchange failed
        Google-->>Back: 400 { "error": "invalid_grant" }
        Back-->>Front: 401 { "error": "google_token_exchange_failed" }
      else Token exchange success
        Google-->>Back: { access_token, id_token, refresh_token?, expires_in }
        Back->>Back: Verify id_token signature & claims (aud, iss, exp)
        alt id_token invalid
          Back-->>Front: 403 { "error": "invalid_id_token" }
        else id_token valid
          Back->>DB: SELECT * FROM users WHERE google_id = sub
          alt User found
            DB-->>Back: user_row
          else User not found
            Back->>DB: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = payload.email
            alt Email exists with other provider
              DB-->>Back: conflict_row
              Back-->>Front: 409 { "error": "email_already_used" }

              DB-->>Back: created_user
            end
          end
          Back->>Back: Generate app JWT + refresh token
          Note over Back,Front: Response includes access_token JSON + HttpOnly refresh_token cookie
          Back-->>Front: 200 { "access_token": "APP_JWT", "user": {...} }
        end
      end
    end
  end

  Note over Front,User: 5) Front stores access_token and redirects to dashboard
```

#### ‚úâÔ∏è Local Signup with Email Verification (SendGrid)

This diagram describes the signup process using email/password and SendGrid for verification:

- user submits the signup form,

- backend hashes the password and creates a user record with is_verified=false,

- backend generates a verification token and sends the email via SendGrid,

- user clicks the verification link, backend validates the token, and marks the account as verified.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as User (browser)
  participant Front as Frontend (Next.js)
  participant Back as Backend (AuthService)
  participant DB as Database
  participant SG as SendGrid (Email API)

  Note over User,Back: 1) Signup request
  User->>Front: Fill signup form (email, password)
  Front->>Back: POST /api/auth/signup {email, password}
  Back->>DB: Check if email exists
  alt Email already exists
    DB-->>Back: user found
    Back-->>Front: 409 {error: "email already exists"}
  else New user
    DB-->>Back: no user found
    Back->>Back: Hash password using bcrypt
    Back->>DB: INSERT user {email, password_hash, is_verified=false}
    Back->>Back: Generate verification token (JWT or random string)
    Back->>SG: Send email with link /verify-email?token=XYZ
    SG-->>Back: Email sent confirmation
    Back-->>Front: 200 {message: "signup success, verify your email"}
  end

  Note over User,Back: 2) Email verification
  User->>Front: Click verification link (/verify-email?token=XYZ)
  Front->>Back: GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=XYZ
  Back->>Back: Validate token (check signature, expiry, or DB)
  alt Token invalid or expired
    Back-->>Front: 400 {error: "invalid or expired token"}
  else Token valid
    Back->>DB: UPDATE user SET is_verified=true
    Back-->>Front: 200 {message: "email verified"}
  end
```

#### üìà Statistics Generation

This diagram illustrates the scheduled statistics pipeline:

- a scheduler triggers the AutoStatistic service daily,

- AutoStatistic retrieves base statistics and computes metrics (visitors, beneficiaries, available actions),

- results are inserted/updated in the database as daily snapshots, with error handling and reporting.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Scheduler as Scheduler Service (CRON)
    participant AutoStat as AutoStatistic Service
    participant StatModule as Statistic Module
    participant DB as PostgreSQL Database

    Note over Scheduler,AutoStat: Scheduler triggers daily calculation
    Scheduler->>AutoStat: runDailyCalculation()

    Note over AutoStat,StatModule: AutoStat calls Statistic Module
    AutoStat->>StatModule: getBaseStatistics()
    StatModule->>DB: SELECT * FROM autostatistic
    DB-->>StatModule: list of auto statistics
    StatModule-->>AutoStat: return statistics list

    loop For each auto statistic
        AutoStat->>AutoStat: calculate visitors, beneficiaries, available actions
        AutoStat->>DB: INSERT INTO dailystat (autostatistic_id date metric_key value) ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET value
        alt Insert/update successful
            DB-->>AutoStat: 200 OK
        else Insert/update fails
            DB-->>AutoStat: 500 Internal Server Error
            AutoStat->>Scheduler: logError(statisticId, error)
        end
    end

    AutoStat-->>Scheduler: 200 OK / Error report
```

## üåêAPI Specifications

This section documents all internal and external APIs integrated into the application.  
It includes authentication flows, content management, statistics, user management, and partner/event services.  
Each subsection provides context, purpose, and expected usage to guide developers and maintainers.

### üåê External APIs

External APIs include third-party services integrated into the system for authentication, email, events, and donations.  
Each service is embedded securely or accessed via backend routes depending on its purpose.

| API | Purpose | Integration | Notes |
|-----|---------|------------|-------|
| **Google OAuth** | Allow users to log in with their Google account | Backend routes `/api/auth/google/url` (GET) & `/api/auth/google` (POST) | OAuth flow: backend generates login URL, exchanges authorization code for access token, and returns JWT to frontend. Used for quick signup/login without password. |
| **WeezEvent** | Display events or donation information | Frontend iframe | Embedded directly on the homepage. Provides information about ongoing campaigns or events. No backend route needed. |
| **HelloAsso** | Handle donations | Frontend iframe | Embedded on donation pages. Users can donate without leaving the site. No backend route needed. |
| **SendGrid** | Send verification emails and notifications | Backend service | Triggered internally when a user signs up or needs to verify their email. Ensures reliable email delivery. No API route is exposed publicly; all email operations happen server-side. |

#### Google OAuth

**Purpose:** Allow users to log in with their Google account.  
**Integration:** Backend routes `/api/auth/google/url` (GET) & `/api/auth/google` (POST).  
**Notes:** OAuth flow is handled securely on the backend. Exchanges authorization code for JWT.
**Flow:**

1. Visitor clicks "Login with Google" button.
2. Backend generates Google OAuth URL and redirects user.
3. User authorizes app; Google returns an authorization code.
4. Backend exchanges code for access_token and returns app JWT.

#### Weezevent

**Purpose:** Display upcoming events and allow users to buy tickets directly.  
**Integration:** Embedded via iframe on the front-end, no backend route required.  
**Notes:** Payments and ticketing are managed fully by Weezevent, so no sensitive data is stored in our system.

**Flow:**

1. User visits "Events" page.
2. Frontend loads Weezevent iframe with organization‚Äôs ID.
3. User browses events and selects tickets inside the iframe.
4. Payment and confirmation are handled directly by Weezevent.

#### HelloAsso

**Purpose:** Enable users to make donations online.  
**Integration:** Embedded via iframe on the front-end, no backend route required.  
**Notes:** Donation flows, payment handling, and receipts are fully managed by HelloAsso. No sensitive payment data is stored in our system.

**Flow:**

1. User navigates to "Donations" page.
2. Frontend loads HelloAsso iframe with campaign or organization‚Äôs ID.
3. User selects donation amount and fills in required details directly in iframe.
4. Payment and confirmation are processed by HelloAsso.
5. User receives confirmation email from HelloAsso (outside our system).

#### SendGrid

**Purpose:** Manage professional and reliable email delivery (transactional and notification emails).  
**Integration:** Backend service calls SendGrid API via official SDK (`@sendgrid/mail`).  
**Notes:** Used for email verification during signup, password reset, and transactional messages (e.g., account confirmation, testimonial approval).

**Flow:**

1. User performs an action that requires an email (e.g., account signup).
2. Backend generates a verification token or transactional payload (e.g., JWT or stored token).
3. Backend calls SendGrid SDK to send an email with recipient, subject, template ID and dynamic data (including verification link with token).
4. SendGrid receives the request and delivers the email to the user.
5. User clicks verification link or follows instructions in the email.
6. Backend validates the token (checks existence, expiry, and association with user) and completes the process.

## üõ†Ô∏èSCM & QA Strategies

### <img src="https://github.com/JeffToken31/Portfolio-project-Zafira/blob/main/stage3/annexes/logoGit.png" alt="test icone" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> GitHub Workflow ‚Äì Source Code Management

We use GitHub to manage our source code. Here is our workflow and rules:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Branches

- Main: Stable, production-ready code.
- Dev: Development branch, where all new features and fixes are integrated before going to Main.
- Issue branches: One branch per issue (fix, add, feat, etc.).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Development Workflow

1. Create an Issue before commit
Title should start with a keyword describing the change:
    Fix ‚Üí bug fix
    Add ‚Üí add a feature
    Feat ‚Üí new functionality
Example: Fix login page

2. Create a local branch  

```bash
git checkout -b <title>/#<issue-number>
or
git checkout -b <issue-number>-<title>

Example: 
git checkout -b fix-login/#12
git checkout -b issue-11-Task5-of-the-stage3
```

3. Develop and commit  

```bash
git commit -m '(close #<issue_number>) : description of the commit'
or
git commit -m 'description of the commit (close #<issue_number>)'
Example: 
git commit -m '(close #12) : corrected login form'
git commit -m 'Add Task5 of the stage3 (close#11)'
```

```bash
Coding example in our Portfolio:
# Control and change the branch
git status
git switch dev
# Create and switch to a new branch (with no spaces)
git checkout -b Task5-of-the-stage3
# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Task5 of the stage3 (#11)"
# Push branch to origin
git push origin Task5-of-the-stage3
```

4. Push & Pull Request  

```bash
git push origin <title>/#<issue_number>
```

- Open a Pull Request from your branch to Dev.
- After review and approval ‚Üí merge into Dev.

5. Merge Dev into Main  

- Once Dev is stable and tested, merge into Main for production.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow Diagram (Concise View)

```bash
Main (stable) <----- Dev (development) <----- Feature/Issue branches
```

#### ‚úÖ Benefits

Clear traceability of changes via Issues.  
Organized development with isolated feature branches.  
Gradual and controlled integration into Main.
